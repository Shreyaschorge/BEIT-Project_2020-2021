### Description

Farmers these days do not get proper value for the farm produce. They strive so hard yet
are compelled to sell their produce at a low price. The middleman forces the farmer to sell
his produce at a low rate.

These middlemen then sell the same farm produce in the cities or to distributors at a high
cost. Thus, the middlemen are at an advantage while the farmers and vendors suffer a huge
amount of loss.

Instead of going through the chain of middlemen, farmers can directly sell their goods to the
distributors of major cities.

Krishisetu allows the farmers to register themselves and sell their goods online. Also making sure that the platform could maintain high traffic and scale up and scale down
whenever necessary and it is always available to serve its users.
